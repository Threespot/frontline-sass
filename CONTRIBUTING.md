### The Code of Conduct

Frontline Sass strongly values contributors from anywhere, regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. As a result, the team has agreed to and enforces this code of conduct in order to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in the development of Frontline Sass.

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body type, race, age, or religion. It also includes the posting of sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Further, harassment includes ad-hominem attacks, grandstanding, derogatory comments, trolling, public or private community disruption, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Harassment is not tolerated in our issue tracker, code, events, chat channels, over emails, or any other way you can communicate with a contributor. Anyone who is asked to cease harassment is expected to comply immediately. Our team is not exempt from this policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please open an issue or contact a team member.
